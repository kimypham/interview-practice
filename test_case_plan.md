# Test Case Plan: Load More Jobs Feature (Updated for App)

## 1. JobBoard.service.tsx (fetchJobsFromApi)

-   should fetch the correct number of jobs based on offset and limit
-   should return an empty array if offset exceeds available jobs
-   should handle cases where fewer jobs are available than requested (overrequesting)
-   should handle network/API errors gracefully

## 2. JobBoard.service.test.tsx

-   should test all scenarios above for fetchJobsFromApi

## 3. LoadMoreButton.tsx

-   should render the button with correct text
-   should call the onClick handler when clicked

## 4. LoadMoreButton.test.tsx

-   should test all scenarios above for LoadMoreButton

## 5. JobBoard.tsx

-   should display initial jobs on mount
-   should append 6 more jobs when Load More is clicked
-   should not fetch more jobs if all jobs are already loaded
-   should display error message if job fetching fails
-   should handle rapid multiple clicks gracefully (no duplicate jobs)
-   should hide the LoadMoreButton when all jobs are loaded
-   should only append the remaining jobs if fewer than requested remain (overrequesting)

## 6. JobBoard.test.tsx

-   should test all scenarios above for JobBoard

## 7. App.tsx

-   should render the JobBoard component as the main content

## 8. App.test.tsx

-   should render the job board title
-   should render 6 job cards when jobs are loaded
-   should render the load more button
-   should show error message when fetch fails
-   should retry fetching jobs when clicking retry button after error
-   should test integration of Load More feature and error handling in the App context

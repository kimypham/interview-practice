-   Assert that a line break (`<hr />` or similar) exists immediately after the table in `DataTable.tsx`.

## 2. Dropdown for row selection

-   Assert that a dropdown exists below the line break in `DataTable.tsx`.
-   Assert that the dropdown defaults to "Show 5".
-   Assert that the dropdown contains options for "Show 5", "Show 10", and "Show 20".

-   Assert that the "Prev" button is disabled.

## 4. Page information text

-   Assert that text displaying "Page X of Y" exists to the right of the "Prev" button in `DataTable.tsx`.
-   Assert that the values for X and Y are variables and can be changed.

## 5. "Next" button

-   Assert that a button labeled "Next" exists to the right of the page information text in `DataTable.tsx`.

## 6. App.tsx renders required UI elements

    -   The dropdown for row selection (with correct default and options)
    -   The disabled "Prev" button

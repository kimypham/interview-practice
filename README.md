# Interview practice

This repo will be used during Canva's AI coding interview where I'm expected to implement some frontend questions using AI.
The majority of this code will be AI generated by Cursor.

Look at the different branches for some example questions I've tried from [greatfrontend.com's practice questions for UI interviews](https://www.greatfrontend.com/front-end-interview-playbook/user-interface#best-practice-questions)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/kimypham/interview-practice

```

And if you want to switch to any of my branches, use this:

```
git switch [branch name]
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Run the app locally:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

4. Run tests:

```

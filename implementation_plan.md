# Implementation Plan: Load More Jobs Feature (Updated for App)

## 1. Update fetchJobsFromApi in JobBoard.service.tsx

-   Modify the function to accept parameters for offset and limit, so it can fetch a specific range of job IDs.
-   Ensure the function returns the correct slice of jobs based on these parameters.
-   If the requested limit exceeds the number of remaining jobs, return only the remaining jobs.

## 2. Update JobBoard.service.test.tsx

-   Add or update unit tests to cover the new parameters and logic in fetchJobsFromApi, including edge cases (e.g., requesting more jobs than available, offset exceeds available jobs).

## 3. Update LoadMoreButton.tsx

-   Update the component to accept an onClick prop for handling button clicks.

## 4. Update LoadMoreButton.test.tsx

-   Add or update unit tests to verify the onClick handler is called when the button is clicked.

## 5. Update JobBoard.tsx

-   Track the number of jobs currently displayed (e.g., with a state variable for offset/count).
-   Update the logic to fetch and append more jobs when LoadMoreButton is clicked.
-   Ensure jobs are accumulated and displayed correctly.
-   Hide the LoadMoreButton when all jobs have been loaded.

## 6. Update JobBoard.test.tsx

-   Add or update unit tests to verify that jobs are loaded initially and that clicking the Load More button fetches and displays additional jobs.
-   Test error handling and edge cases (e.g., no more jobs to load, overrequesting jobs, LoadMoreButton is hidden when all jobs are loaded).

## 7. Update App.tsx

-   Ensure App.tsx renders the JobBoard component as the main content.

## 8. Update App.test.tsx

-   Add or update integration tests to verify that the JobBoard is rendered within the App, including:
    -   The board title is displayed
    -   The correct number of job cards are rendered
    -   The Load More button is present and functional
    -   Error handling and retry logic work as expected
